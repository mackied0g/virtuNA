# virtuNA

virtu-NA, or Virtual NA, is an open source web app to increase the accessibility and retention of Narcotics Anonymous. We created this web app for those who wouldn't be able to attend meetings in person due to license revocation, financial instability, unrealiable transportation and more. There are plenty of reasons why addicts may not be able to get the care they need, so we want to make Narcotics Anonymous more accessible to anyone who needs it. 

We created this app for the Facebook New York Developer Community Hackathon 2019. 

### Disclaimer:
This is not meant to be a replacement for in-person treatment if the option is available and accessible. If you are able to attend in-person meetings, you should do so. 

#### Currently, we are using:

- Node.js (10.15.2)
- React.js (16.9.0)
- WebSockets (1.0.30)
